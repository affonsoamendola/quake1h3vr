  Description: 'This is my port of E1M1 from Quake!


    Features:

    - Doors! (Proximity or triggerable)

    - Secret Areas (They are empty in sandbox, but you can put stuff there!)

    - Push Buttons (I dont know how to make them pushable by hand, so use a weapon
    to push them, or just shoot at them)


    I''m currently working on adding Quake''s sounds and the sky animation.


    Also I want this to be the basis for a a "speedrun" gamemode of sorts, I''ll populate
    the map with sosigs where they would be in Quake, and lets see how long you take
    to complete it in VR!


    Original Creator is the LEGENDARY John Romero (Please dont sue, this is a labour
    of love!)


    Many Thanks to nrgill28 for the help and for Atlas!'
