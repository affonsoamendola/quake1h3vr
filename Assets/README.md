# Quake E1M1 conversion for H3VR
https://github.com/affonsoamendola/quake1h3vr

This is my port of Quake's E1M1 for Hotdogs, Horseshoes and Handgrenades.

Feel free to send me a dm via Discord should you find any bugs, or @ me on the modding server there, everything SHOULD be working properly, but you never know. 

Features:
- Push Buttons! (I dont know how to make them pushable with an empty hand, without being able to pull them out of the "socket", but you can push them with weapons and other objects, or just shoot them!)
- Doors! (Triggerable by proximity, or by buttons or really whatever you want)
- Elevators! (Really they are just vertical doors :P)
- Secret Areas (They are totally empty in Sandbox, but you can put stuff there if you want!, also they work exactly like in hte original game, so shoot doors, and some other areas on the map.)
- Blinking Lights! (Yes, I implemented the same pattern as in the original.)

Future Ideas:
- Sounds! (I am currently working on adding the original ambient sounds from Quake, should be pretty cool)
- Speedrun Gamemode (The idea is for this map to be the basis of a speedrun gamemode where you start at the beginning and have to go through the map, with pre-positioned sosigs where enemies would be in the original game, and weapons at the secret areas, ammo drops, etc, thats the plan!)
- Take and Hold Map (I dont know if Atlas supports TNH yet, but it should be possible eventually to add some supply points around, this map is surprisingly circular, should be a pretty decent TNH map)
- Quake Guns (I asked nicely to Gunlovers if I can use the weapons from Quake they ported to their mod, STRAFESCRAPPER https://h3vr.thunderstore.io/package/Gunlovers/STRAFESCRAPPER_ICONIC_UPDATE/ and they said I could, so thats coming in the future maybe, still have to figure out some stuff.)

MANY thanks to nrgill28 for all the help while I was learning to mod this thing, and for all the work on Atlas and other mods!

Also many thanks to the LEGENDARY John Romero, the original creator of this map back in the 90s, I remember playing Quake in my old AMD-K6-2, I absolutely love it, and a big reason for that is probably E1M1, this is a perfect introduction to the game, I wish the process of porting was simpler, so I could port more maps, and maybe have the entire shareware episode, but thats very unlikely.
